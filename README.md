# BeamArmor and MIMO-RIC

This is a wireless system build on top of srsRAN's 4G software RAN stack.
It contains an O-RAN driven RIC named MIMO-RIC that is specifically geared towards hosting MIMO-related xApps/Î¼Apps.
One of these Apps is BeamArmor, which is included in this repo. BeamArmor is a null-steering enabled anti-jamming application that can mitigate the interference effect of jamming signals in UL traffic.

## Installing the repo
Installation is done by building srsRAN in the default manner. Create a build directory inside srsRAN, run cmake ../ and make inside the build directory. The default configuration file enb.conf can be installed from the srsRAN/build/ directory by executing 'srsran_install_configs.sh'.

## Preparing BeamArmor and MIMO-RIC
Before running the srsRAN base station with MIMO-RIC and BeamArmor, the operation mode of the srsenb must be set to MIMO and the number of ports must be specified. Set tm = 4 and nof_ports = 2 inside the [enb] paragraph of enb.conf (usually installed in home/.config/srsran/).

To turn the MIMO-RIC as well as the BeamArmor App on, one needs to modify the /srsRAN/srsenb/src/phy/txrx.cc source code file. Inisde the run_thread() method one can set the variables mimo_ric_on and beam_armor_on to true to activate the MIMO-RIC and BeamArmor systems respectively.

The controller itself is run in form of the Python script compute_alpha_server.py. Inside the script, one can activate the BeamArmor app by calling the compute_alpha function inside the main function of the script.

## Running the srsenb with MIMO-RIC and BeamArmor
The srsRAN base station can be run by executing the core application srsepc and the base station application srsenb. Execute 'sudo /srsRAN/build/srsepc/src/srsepc ~/.config/srsran/epc.conf' followed by 'sudo /srsRAN/build/srsenb/sc/srsenb ~/.config/srsran/enb.conf' in another terminal.
Execute the Python script inside a 3rd terminal to run the controller by executing 'python3 alpha_compute_server.py'. From now on, the srsenb program communicates at a set periodicity with the MIMO-RIC.

## Parameters of MIMO-RIC
To change the periodicity, look for the function calls 'send_y1y2' and 'poll_alpha' inside the run_thread() method (txrx.cc), and set the if-condition 'if (tti % 50 == 0)' to any value you prefer instead of every 50 TTI.
The MIMO-RIC logic includes sending the IQ samples recevied by antenna ports 1 and 2 of the srsenb to the controller. The down-sampling rate of these IQ samples can be adjusted inside the 'send_y1y2' function in /srsRAN/srsenb/src/phy/txrx.cc. To do so, adjust the increment value of the for-loop 'for (int i = 0; i < (int)sf_len; i += 40). Currently, the down-sampling rate is 40x. When adjusting the down-sampling rate, the variable 'int size = (int)sf_len/10;' must be adjusted accordingly.
